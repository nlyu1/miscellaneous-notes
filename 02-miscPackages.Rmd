## Installing CMake

Installing newest version of cmake: find latest version [here](https://cmake.org/download/), specify version and build (e.g. `4.0.3` is as below): 
```
version=4.0
build=3
## don't modify from here
wget https://cmake.org/files/v$version/cmake-$version.$build.tar.gz
tar -xzvf cmake-$version.$build.tar.gz
cd cmake-$version.$build/

./bootstrap
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

This should have installed cmake to `/usr/local/bin`. If this is this not in path, run 

```
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
