## Basic commands {-}

:::{.definition name="containers and images"}
A docker **image** is an immutable file (collection). A **container** is a running (and mutable) instance of an image. Container can be crystallized into containers. 
:::

1. **Running containers**: `docker container run hello-world`
    - **Interactive mode**: `docker container run -it ubuntu bash`. 
    - `docker container run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND]`
    - _Remove after execution_: `docker container run --rm ubuntu ls .`
    - Run with name: `docker container run -it --name [name] [doncainter name] [command]`
    - Run with binding: `docker container run ... -v FILE-IN-HOST:FILE-IN-CONTAINER`. Binds will be visible on both sides. 
2. **Image ops**: 
    - **Listing**: `docker image ls`
2. **Container operations**: 
    - Listing: `docker container ls -a` (includes exited ones)
    - Deleting: `docker container rm [ID prefix]`. 
    - **Starting an initialized container**: `docker start [container name]`
        - Start with $-it$ to create a binding, interactive process 
    - **Kill main process of running container**: `docker kill [container]`
    - **Create additional connection**: `docker exec -it [name] /bin/bash`. 
3. **Committing & manipulation**: 
    - `docker commit CONTAINER-ID-OR-CONTAINER-NAME NEW-IMAGE-NAME`
    - **Copy**:     docker container cp [local path] [image-name]:[container path]

Sample docker image: `pytorch/pytorch:2.7.0-cuda11.8-cudnn9-devel`

Sample workflow 
```

docker container ls -a 
docker image ls -a 

docker container run -it --gpus all --name gpu_starter pytorch/pytorch:2.7.0-cuda11.8-cudnn9-devel

docker start gpu_starter
docker attach 
docker exec -it gpu_starter /bin/bash
docker kill gpu_starter 

docker container cp 01-docker.Rmd  gpu_starter:/workspace
```

## Dockerfile {-}

Dockerfile defines the workflow for building an image. 

Sample dockerfile: 
```
FROM pytorch/pytorch:2.7.0-cuda11.8-cudnn9-devel
COPY ./simple.py /workspace 
CMD python /workspace/simple.py
``` 

Where `simple.py` 

1. Run in the dockerfile folder: 
`docker build . -t gpu_starter`
2. Running: `docker container run --gpus all --name gpu -p 8888:8888 --rm -it gpu_starter`

## Docker compose 

Note that the workflow above still involves (1) using the `Dockerfile` to build an image, and (2) running the image with specified parameters. The second can be automated by `docker compose`. Equivalent specification in `docker-compose.yml`: 

```
services:
  app: 
    image: pytorch/pytorch:2.7.0-cuda11.8-cudnn9-devel
    build: .
    stdin_open: true 
    tty: true 
    ports:
      - 8888:8888
    gpus: all 
    volumes: 
      - ~/Downloads:/workspace/downloads
```

- Running `docker compose up --build` will create the image and 
    - Images are retained. Remove by `docker compose down --rmi all` 
    - Use `docker compose up --build -d` to detach after building 
- Compose up will also automatically create containers. Use `docker compose down` to remove all containers for compose services. 
- Run `docker container ls -a` and `docker attach [container]` to interact

## Publishing images {-}

To publish, run 
```
docker login
docker tag sample_image:latest nlyu1/sample_image:latest
docker push nlyu1/sample_image:latest
```
To pull from elsewhere, run `docker pull nlyu1/sample_image:latest`. 

## Explanation from ChatGPT {-}

When you run `docker compose up` and `down`, Compose is really orchestrating the same Docker primitives you know from `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker stop`, and `docker rm`—but it does it for *all* your services in one go.

---

### 1. Which Dockerfile is used? Do I see the build logs?

* **Build context & Dockerfile location**
  Because you have

  ```yaml
  build: .
  ```

  Compose will look in `.` (your project root) for a file named `Dockerfile`.
* **Image tag**
  You also set

  ```yaml
  image: hiyouga/llamafactory:latest
  ```

  so after it builds that Dockerfile, it tags the resulting image as `hiyouga/llamafactory:latest`.
* **Logs**

  * If the image doesn’t already exist locally (or if you pass `--build`), Compose will invoke `docker build .` for you and stream the usual build logs right into your terminal.
  * On subsequent `up` calls, if nothing has changed in the build context, Compose will skip the rebuild unless you force it.

---

### 2. What happens when you run `docker compose up`? {-}

1. **Networks & volumes**
   Compose creates any networks and named volumes declared in your file (if they don’t already exist).
2. **Images**

   * For services with a `build:` block, it builds (or reuses) the image.
   * For services without `build:`, it pulls from registry if missing.
3. **Containers**

   * If no container exists for `llamafactory`, it **creates** one (same as `docker create …`) and then **starts** it.
   * If a container **has** already been created by Compose:

     * **Unchanged config:** it simply starts the stopped container (so you keep your previous data in volumes, etc.).
     * **Changed config or forced recreate:** Compose will tear down the old container and spin up a fresh one.
4. **Flags you recognize**

   * `stdin_open: true` + `tty: true` → the `-it` behavior
   * `ipc: host`, `gpus: all`, `ports:`, `volumes:` → passed straight through under the hood

You can always run

```bash
docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```

to rebuild images and recreate containers every time.

---

### 3. What happens when you run `docker compose down`? {-}

* **Stops** all running containers in that Compose project (same as `docker stop`).
* **Removes** those containers and the default network that Compose created.
* **Leaves** behind:

  * The images you built or pulled.
  * Any named volumes (so your data survives) unless you add `-v`.
* If you want to clean everything up, you can do:

  ```bash
  docker compose down --rmi all -v
  ```

  which also removes images (`--rmi all`) and named volumes (`-v`).

---

#### TL;DR Workflow {-}

1. **Write your Dockerfile** in `.`
2. **Declare** in `docker-compose.yml` both `build: .` and `image: your/name:tag` if you want a custom build **and** a consistent tag
3. **`docker compose up`**

   * builds (if needed),
   * creates (if needed),
   * starts (or restarts) your containers
4. **`docker compose down`**

   * stops & removes containers and network,
   * leaves images & volumes unless you tell it otherwise

That’s the Compose lifecycle mapping back to the classic Docker commands you already know.
